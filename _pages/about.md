Nice to meet you😊!  

# About Me  
Hi! I’m Yunchong Xiao, a Master’s student in Electronic Information at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, working under the supervision of Prof. Xie Chen in the Cross-Media (X-) Language Intelligence Lab (X-LANCE) Lab. My research focuses on making speech technologies both privacy-aware and practically deployable, blending algorithmic rigor with real-world engineering insights.

What I care about:

- 🔒 Protecting speaker identities in voice data without sacrificing AI model performance  
- ⚙️ Building efficient pipelines to turn "wild" web audio into reliable training resources
- 🤝 Collaborating with interdisciplinary teams to solve open challenges in speech processing


# Education
